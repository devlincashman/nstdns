# Updates the DNS record of your domain registered on GoDaddy to the current IP assigned to your internet connection.
# Inspired by https://uk.godaddy.com/community/Managing-Domains/Dynamic-DNS-Updates/td-p/7862.
#
# Automatically verifies that the DNS record has been updated successfully.
# Returns:
# - exit code 0: success
# - exit code 1: any failure that prevented the DNS record to be updated
#
# Setup:
# - Go to https://developer.godaddy.com/getstarted and create a developer account.
# - Get valid **production** credentials (a KEY and a SECRET) to access the API.
#   Do not select testing, otherwise changes are not exposed.
# - Provide environment variable as described below, feel free to customize defaults.
#
# Expected environment variables, with some defaults:
#
# DOMAIN                # domain name you want to update, e.g., "example.com"
TYPE=${TYPE:-"A"}     # record type, e.g., "A"
NAME=${NAME:-"@"}     # name of the record to update, e.g., "@"
TTL=${TTL:-"1800"}    # time to live, seconds, e.g., "1800"
PORT=${PORT:-"1"}     # required port, e.g., "1"
WEIGHT=${WEIGHT:-"1"} # required weight, e.g., "1"
# KEY                   # KEY for accessing GoDaddy developer API
# SECRET                # SECRET for the above KEY
PHASE=${PHASE:-"0"} # initial sleep before script execution
#   useful for shifting phase in case of multiple script executing
#   at the same time
#
# usually no need to modify beyond this point
